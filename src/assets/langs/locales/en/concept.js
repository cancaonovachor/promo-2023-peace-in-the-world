      Choirs around the world will hold a 24-hour concert relay of Karl Jenkins’ “The Peacemakers” on the International Day of Peace, 21 September 2023. Through the music on words by people of different religions, ethnicities and cultures for making peace, we will share our wish for peace beyond differences in nationality and culture. In Japan, three active choirs will hold a joint concert on Monday, 18 September, inviting a German conductor, Dieter Wagner, from Switzerland. The concert repertoire will be an excellent line-up of excerpt from “The Peacemakers” as wells as gems of German choral music. A digest video of the concert will be shown in the BOX of the Lucerne Theatre and streamed via the website of TimeDate on Thursday, 21 September.
